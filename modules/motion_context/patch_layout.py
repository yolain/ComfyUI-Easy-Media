# code based on https://github.com/NikoDemon80/ComfyUI-H3-Motion-Context/blob/main/patch_layout.py
"""Lift MiniMax H3's first/last-only keyframe anchor restriction.

Stock ComfyUI builds keyframe conditioning rows at one of two time
coordinates and rejects everything else:

    if pixel_index == 0:
        cond_t = float(text_len)
    elif frame_count is not None and pixel_index == frame_count - 1:
        cond_t = float(text_len) + sum(_video_t_spans(latent_t)) - FRAME_RESCALE
    else:
        raise ValueError("only first/last keyframe anchors are supported")

Both branches are the same expression. Each video token spans
FRAME_RESCALE * FRAME_PER_TOKEN[k % 5] and covers FRAME_PER_TOKEN[k % 5]
pixel frames, so the cumulative time at pixel frame p is exactly
FRAME_RESCALE * p, for every p. Substituting p = frame_count - 1
reproduces the second branch identically:

    text_len + FRAME_RESCALE * (frame_count - 1)
      == text_len + FRAME_RESCALE * frame_count - FRAME_RESCALE
      == text_len + sum(_video_t_spans(latent_t)) - FRAME_RESCALE

So the general position is:

    cond_t = text_len + FRAME_RESCALE * pixel_index

We do NOT rewrite the source of PackedLayout.__init__. Instead every
keyframe is handed to stock code with resolved_frame_index = 0, which is
always legal, and the real index rides along under MC_KEY. After the
stock constructor returns we rewrite the time column of each cond
segment's rows in position_ids. RoPE is built at forward time from
position_ids, so this lands before anything reads it.

That keeps the patch surface to one attribute we can verify rather than a
copy of a 90-line constructor that would rot on the next ComfyUI change.

    the target. That distinction decided continuation vs reproduction for
    video, and seam analysis showed the audio reference producing
    phase-unlocked imitation. So: keep the audio on the reference path for
    construction and payload (rows built, latents filled, all stock code

    The block keeps its place in the cursor, so the coordinates it vacates

    Returns None, "same" or "other".

    Two copies of this patch in one ComfyUI is normal enough: several
    packs vendor it, and forks of this repo carry their own. Whichever
    loads second would otherwise capture the first's wrapper as its
    original and wrap a wrapper. That is worse than it sounds, because
    each copy self-tests through whatever is already installed, so a copy
    with newer tests gets checked against older behaviour and refuses
    over a limitation that no longer exists.

    Three checks, in decreasing confidence.

    The marker is set by copies new enough to set it. That is a matching
    version and we stand down quietly.

    A wrapper merely NAMED like ours is an older copy of this code, or a
    fork. We stand down and say so, because whichever one loaded first is
    the one deciding what the patch supports.

    Anything else sitting where the stock constructor should be is a
    DIFFERENT pack patching the same thing. Several H3 packs lift the
    same first/last restriction independently, and they cannot both own
    the constructor. Detected by comparing where the function was defined
    against where the class was: stock's __init__ comes from the same
    module as PackedLayout itself, a wrapper comes from somewhere else.
    functools.wraps copies __module__ across, so __wrapped__ is checked
    too. A wrapper that hides both is indistinguishable from stock and
    nothing can be done about that.
