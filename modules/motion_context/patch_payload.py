# code based on https://github.com/NikoDemon80/ComfyUI-H3-Motion-Context/blob/main/patch_layout.py
"""Let keyframes and refs coexist.

`MiniMaxH3.extra_conds` in comfy/model_base.py fills the payload from two
independent `if` blocks. The keyframe block sets `cond_video_latents`, then
the refs block **overwrites** it:

    if keyframes is not None:
        payload["cond_video_latents"] = [kf["latent"] for kf in keyframes]
    if refs is not None:
        payload["cond_video_latents"] = [r["latent"] for r in refs if "latent" in r]
        payload["cond_audio_latents"] = [r["audio_latent"] for r in refs ...]

So attaching an audio-only ref alongside keyframes wipes the keyframe video
content: an audio-only block has no "latent" key, the list comes back empty,
and the cond rows the layout built have nothing to fill them.

The layout itself handles the combination fine. Keyframe cond rows are
emitted first, ref rows second, target rows last, which is exactly the order
the forward pass expects when it writes rows into the never-denoised slots.
Only this payload assignment is in the way.

This wrapper re-runs the same logic and concatenates instead, keeping
keyframe latents first to match the row order.

It only does that for graphs that asked for it. The wrapper is installed
process-wide, but it returns stock output unless a keyframe or a ref
carries one of this pack's markers. Graphs that combine stock keyframes
and refs without going anywhere near Motion Context therefore behave
exactly as they did before the pack was installed. That matters because
such graphs exist: a Ref2VA workflow with a last_frame anchor is a
legitimate combination of both mechanisms and has nothing to do with
chaining. Whether stock's overwrite is a bug there is not this pack's
call to make.

Graphs using only one mechanism are unaffected either way: with no refs
the ref list is empty, with no keyframes the keyframe list is.

The order is what makes this safe under Ref2VA, where the ref list holds
the graph's own image, video and audio blocks as well as ours. Stock
builds the layout as text, then cond rows, then reference blocks in list
order, so keyframe latents first and reference latents in list order is
exactly the order the rows are waiting in. Audio is filled from the same
list in the same order, and an audio-only block contributes nothing to
the video list, so the two stay in step however the graph is wired.
