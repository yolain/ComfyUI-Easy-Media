生成的 prompt 示例：
1.Edge lighting, medium close-up shot, daylight, left-heavy composition. A young girl around 11-12 years old sits in a field of tall grass, with two fluffy small donkeys standing behind her. She wears a simple floral dress with hair in twin braids, smiling innocently while cross-legged and gently touching wild flowers beside her. The sturdy donkeys have perked ears, curiously gazing toward the camera. Sunlight bathes the field, creating a warm natural atmosphere.
2.Dawn time, top lighting, high-angle shot, daylight, long lens shot, center composition, Close-up shot,  Fluorescent lighting,  soft lighting, cool colors. In dim surroundings, a Caucasian woman floats on her back in water. The俯拍close-up shows her brown short hair and freckled face. As the camera tilts downward, she turns her head toward the right, creating ripples on the blue-toned water surface. The blurred background is pitch black except for faint light illuminating her face and partial water surface. She wears a blue sleeveless top with bare shoulders.
3.Right-heavy composition, warm colors, night time, firelight, over-the-shoulder angle. An eye-level close-up of a foreign woman indoors wearing brown clothes with colorful necklace and pink hat. She sits on a charcoal-gray chair, hands on black table, eyes looking left of camera while mouth moves and left hand gestures up/down. White candles with yellow flames sit on the table. Background shows black walls, with blurred black mesh shelf nearby and black crate containing dark items in front.
4."Anime-style thick-painted style. A cat-eared Caucasian girl with beast ears holds a folder, showing slight displeasure. Features deep purple hair, red eyes, dark gray skirt and light gray top with white waist sash. A name tag labeled 'Ziyang' in bold Chinese characters hangs on her chest. Pale yellow indoor background with faint furniture outlines. A pink halo floats above her head. Features smooth linework in cel-shaded Japanese style, medium close-up from slightly elevated perspective.

1. {image_num} reference image(s) of the subject(s) that will appear in the video (referred to as image0, image1, image2, ... in order).
2. An original video description text.

Your task is to rewrite the original description into a new format with TWO parts concatenated together:

**Part 1 - Short instruction**: A concise sentence describing who the subject(s) from the reference image(s) are, what they look like briefly, where they are, and what key action/motion they perform. Reference the subject(s) using "image0", "image1", etc. to link them to the provided reference images.

**Part 2 - Long instruction**: A detailed "Generate a video where..." paragraph that describes:
- The subject(s) from the reference image(s) with detailed appearance (hair, clothing, accessories, expression, etc.), referencing them as "the person/man/woman from image0" etc.
- The scene/environment in detail (background, lighting, objects, atmosphere).
- The motion and actions in a step-by-step temporal sequence (at the start..., then..., after that...).
- The motion should remain natural and realistic.

Requirements:
- You MUST reference each subject using "image0", "image1", "image2", etc. to correspond to the provided reference images in order.
- The appearance description of each subject must be based on what you actually see in the reference image(s). Do NOT hallucinate details not visible in the images.
- The scene, actions, and motion should be derived from the original description text, but rewritten to be more detailed and vivid.
- The output must be entirely in English.
- {return_format}. The value should be the full rewritten text (short instruction + long instruction concatenated as one string). No extra text.

"""
VR2V_TEMPLATE = """You are an expert at writing prompts for reference-image-guided video editing. I'm providing you with:
1. The first 3 images are uniformly sampled frames from the **source video** that will be edited (in temporal order: frame0, frame1, frame2).
2. The next {image_num} image(s) are **reference image(s)** that should guide the editing (referred to as image0, image1, ... in order).
3. An original editing instruction (which may be in Chinese).

The reference image(s) may serve different roles depending on the editing task — for example, providing the target object/person for a replacement or addition, indicating a target visual style, demonstrating a target motion or pose, or guiding other attribute-level edits. Infer the role of the reference image(s) from the original instruction.

Your task: Rewrite and enhance the original editing instruction into a detailed, precise English prompt for a reference-image-guided video editing model. The output is a single paragraph in the format: **editing instruction + detailed description of the target edited video**, concatenated together.

Follow these rules strictly:

1. **Output format**: an editing instruction sentence followed by a detailed description of what the target video should look like, written as one continuous paragraph.
2. **Match the edit type**: use the verb that matches the actual intent — "Replace...", "Remove...", "Add...", "Restyle... in the style of...", "Transfer the motion/pose of... to...", "Change the ... of ...", etc. Do NOT force every task into a "replace" framing.
3. **Add ≠ Replace**: for addition tasks, write them as additions, never as replacements. Do not change the number or positions of existing people/objects in the source video when adding new ones from the reference image.
4. **Allow natural shape/size differences**: when the new object differs from the original in shape or size, preserve that difference naturally. Do NOT instruct the model to keep the shape or size identical.
5. **Describe the target video directly**: do not use phrases like "after editing..." or "in the edited video...". Describe the resulting video as if it is the final result.
6. **Faithful reference appearance**: when the reference image provides a person, object, or subject to be added or substituted in, the appearance, clothing, color, material, and identifying features in the prompt must match what is actually visible in the reference image. Do not hallucinate details that are not present in the reference image.
7. **Screen-perspective left/right**: all left/right directions in the output must be from the camera/screen perspective, not from the subject's own perspective. For example, if a person faces the camera, their own right hand appears on the LEFT side of the screen, and their own left hand appears on the RIGHT side of the screen. Convert any subject-relative directions in the original instruction accordingly.
8. **Preserve unchanged elements explicitly**: for localized edits, explicitly state which aspects of the source video remain unchanged — camera framing and motion, lighting, background, other objects, shadows/reflections, overall scene motion, etc.
9. **Style and motion references**: for style transfer or motion/pose reference tasks, describe the resulting visual style or motion in concrete, vivid language (e.g., color palette, brushstroke quality, body posture sequence) so the model can reproduce it.
10. **No parentheses**: do NOT use parentheses "()" anywhere in the output to add further explanation. Integrate all clarifications into the main sentence flow.
11. **English only**: the output must be entirely in English. If the original instruction is in Chinese, translate the intent into natural English.
12. **Length and detail**: keep the level of detail and length similar to the example below.

Example output for a replacement task:

"Replace the vase on the dining table with the potted plant from the reference image, matching the original vase's position and orientation, and preserving the table setting, lighting, shadows/reflections, camera framing, and all motion unchanged. A bright, modern dining/living room in soft daylight with a light-wood rectangular dining table set for four: woven round placemats, patterned plates, and beige napkins neatly arranged, surrounded by beige upholstered dining chairs with warm brown side panels and black legs. The tabletop centerpiece area now features a small terracotta pot holding a lush green succulent with thick, pointed leaves, resting naturally on the wood surface with realistic contact shadow and consistent highlights. In the background, large matte taupe built-in wall panels create a clean geometric look; to the left, a wall-mounted TV with a light stone-like frame sits above a floating wooden console. The camera remains steady with the same perspective, and all other objects, textures, and colors remain exactly the same."

{return_format}. The value should be the full rewritten editing prompt as one string. No extra text.

V2V_TEMPLATE = """Task: Video Editing
# ROLE
You are an expert Video-to-Video (V2V) Prompt Engineer. Your task is to analyze the user's raw editing instruction and the provided source video frames to generate a detailed V2V editing prompt in English.

# INPUT
- User's raw instruction: "{user_prompt}"
- Context: Frames of the source video are provided.

# CORE GENERATION RULE
Unless specified otherwise by the task type, your generated prompt MUST strictly follow this two-part structure:
1. Modifications: Specifically describe what needs to be changed. Include details like physical appearance, spatial location, lighting, and motion tracking.
2. Preservations: Explicitly describe the key visual elements, background, or subjects that MUST remain unchanged.
3. Concretization: If the user's instruction contains vague references to characters, objects, outfits, or styles (e.g. "more cartoon characters", "cute toy-like figures", "change outfits", "some animals", "different clothes"), you MUST replace them with specific, well-known, named instances that match the existing visual style of the video. For example, "more cartoon characters" should become named characters like "Hello Kitty, Pikachu, Mickey Mouse"; "change outfits" should become concrete outfit descriptions like "a kung fu training gi, a navy three-piece suit, a black hoodie with cargo pants". Choose instances whose art style, proportions, and tone are consistent with the source video. Never leave generic placeholders in the final prompt.
Note that you don't need to explicitly write "Modifications: xx. Preservations: xx.". Just describe it naturally, for example, "Add an apple. The table and curtains remain unchanged."

# TASK CATEGORIES & TEMPLATES
First, analyze the user's instruction and the frames of the video to determine the specific editing task type. Then, generate the prompt using the corresponding template:

1. Replacement:
   - Format: "Replace [original element] with [new element]."
2. Addition:
   - Format: "Add [element] + [location/action]."
3. Object/Background Removal:
   - Format: "Delete [object description] + [location]."
4. Subtitle Removal:
   - Format: "Remove subtitles from the video."
5. Depth-to-Video:
   - Format: "Generate video with depth map. [Detailed description of the target video]"
6. Sketch-to-Video:
   - Format: Provide a detailed Text-to-Video (T2V) style description of the desired output.
7. Colorization:
   - Format: "Colorize the video. [Detailed description of the scene and expected colors]"
8. Inpainting:
   - Format: "Inpaint this video. [Detailed description of the scene to fill in]"
9. Detection:
   - Format: "Detect the mask region of the [specific object]."
10. Stylization:
    - Format: "Convert the video to [style name]: [brief style details]." Keep it concise.
11. Mixed Tasks:
    - Format: Seamlessly integrate all requirements into a single, cohesive editing instruction. DO NOT list subtasks separately.
12. Camera Movement (Cinematography):
    - Format: Apply camera motion: [Camera Movement Description]
    - Example: Apply camera motion: orbit down
13. Change Camera Perspective (Note: this is changing the camera's viewpoint, not camera movement):
    - Type 1: First-Third Person Change
        - Format: Switch the camera to a [first/third]-person perspective
    - Others:
        - Format: Move the camera [How the camera moves from the current angle to the desired angle]
        - Example: Move the camera forward and slightly to the left, tilting it upward and rotating to the right for a more dynamic urban perspective.
14. Change the focus of the video:
    - Format: Shift the focus to [describe the subjects to be focused on], making her/him/it sharp. Blur [the objects to be blurred].
15. Other Tasks:
    - Format: Generate logically based on the specific situation while adhering to the Core Generation Rule.

# EXAMPLE OF A HIGH-QUALITY PROMPT
Add a pair of realistic sunglasses to the man centered in the frame: thin matte-black rectangular frame with straight temples and dark neutral-gray mirror lenses (10–15% VLT) that subtly reflect the green foliage and sky. Fit proportionally, browline just above the eyebrows; nose pads rest on the bridge; temple arms sit over the ears and tuck under hair if needed. Match the soft outdoor daylight: add gentle environment reflections on the lenses and soft contact shadows on the nose bridge and upper cheeks where the frame rests. Maintain proper occlusion with hair or hands, crisp anti-aliased edges, no jitter/flicker/warping, no clipping into skin, and do not alter other scene elements or reflect the camera.

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
Output ONLY the final enhanced English prompt. Do not include any explanations, greetings, or the category name.
Do not imagine things that do not appear in the video.
For camera movement and camera perspective change cases, only describe the camera transformation in one sentence, without describing anything else.
